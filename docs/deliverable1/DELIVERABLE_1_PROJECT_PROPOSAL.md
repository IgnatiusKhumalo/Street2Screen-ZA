## 1.1 INTRODUCTION

### Background

South Africa's informal economy represents a critical economic lifeline, employing nearly 20% of the country's workforce and generating approximately R900 billion annually through township trade (Statistics South Africa, 2025; Standard Bank, 2025). This substantial 'Township Economy' operates predominantly through traditional street vending, informal markets, and increasingly through social media platforms. However, the digital transformation of this sector faces significant challenges, including lack of secure payment infrastructure, limited consumer trust, inadequate delivery logistics for non-urban areas, and absence of verified seller identities (World Wide Worx & Mastercard, 2025).

According to the Online Retail in South Africa 2025 report, the country's e-commerce turnover is projected to exceed R130 billion by the end of 2025, representing nearly 10% of total retail spend (World Wide Worx & Mastercard, 2025). While formal retail giants dominate the Business-to-Consumer (B2C) space, a significant portion of this digital expansion is occurring within the Customer-to-Customer (C2C) and informal sectors as individuals seek innovative ways to generate sustainable income.

### Current Operations and Impact

The informal sector has traditionally operated without formal business registration or dedicated digital infrastructure. Most township traders rely on:

- **Cash-based transactions** at physical market stalls
- **Social media platforms** (Facebook Marketplace, WhatsApp groups) for product listings
- **Manual payment methods** (EFT, cash on delivery) without buyer protection
- **Informal delivery arrangements** through taxi networks or personal transport

Research published in the Global Media Journal indicates that while adoption of online shopping among emerging township consumers is growing, it is heavily influenced by consumer attitudes toward convenience and perceived usefulness (Makhitha & Ngobeni, 2023). The absence of localized trust mechanisms in online payments and integrated delivery logistics for non-urban areas creates substantial barriers to digital trade formalisation.

### Desired Future State

Street2Screen ZA aims to bridge the gap between informal trade and secure, digitized marketplaces by developing a locally-contextualised C2C platform specifically designed for South African township entrepreneurs. The platform will provide:

- **Verified seller profiles** to combat digital fraud and build consumer trust
- **Secure payment integration** with local South African payment gateways
- **Multi-language support** for all 11 official languages
- **Low-data optimised interfaces** for users with limited data access
- **Township-friendly logistics integration** supporting non-urban delivery
- **Mobile-first design** reflecting smartphone-dominant internet access patterns

By creating infrastructure that keeps transaction fees and revenues within South Africa, the platform will help formalize the informal sector while providing a sustainable pathway from "survival to scale" for millions of South Africans (Standard Bank, 2025).

### Strategic Alignment

This project aligns with national priorities for:
- **Digital economic transformation** and financial inclusion
- **SMME (Small, Medium, and Micro Enterprises) development** in underserved communities
- **Youth employment** through entrepreneurship enablement
- **Localisation of e-commerce infrastructure** reducing dependency on foreign platforms

The platform addresses a clear market need while contributing to broader socio-economic development goals within the South African context.

## 1.2 NEEDS/PROBLEMS

### Problem Statement

The South African informal economy faces critical barriers preventing its transition into the formal digital marketplace. Despite representing R900 billion in annual economic activity, township traders and emerging entrepreneurs lack access to trusted, secure, and locally-appropriate C2C digital platforms.

### Identified Needs and Problems

#### 2.1 Lack of Trust in Digital Transactions

**Problem:** Consumer reluctance to purchase from unknown sellers due to widespread digital fraud and scams on existing social media marketplaces.

**Statistics:**
- Digital fraud complaints increased by 337% between 2020-2023 in South Africa (Banking Association South Africa, 2023)
- 68% of township consumers express concerns about online payment security (Makhitha & Ngobeni, 2023)

**Duration:** This problem has existed since the emergence of social media commerce platforms (approximately 2015-present), intensifying during and after the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2023).

**Previous Attempts:** Generic international platforms (Facebook Marketplace, Gumtree) have attempted to address this through basic seller ratings, but these systems lack South African context, identity verification, and integration with local financial systems.

**Impact on Target Population:** Township sellers struggle to build customer bases beyond immediate social circles, limiting income generation potential. Buyers risk financial loss through fraud, reducing overall market participation.

**Impact on Surrounding Populations:** Reduced consumer confidence in digital trade perpetuates reliance on cash-based informal markets, limiting economic formalisation and tax revenue collection.

#### 2.2 Digital Exclusion and Platform Inaccessibility

**Problem:** Existing e-commerce platforms are data-intensive, English-dominant, and optimised for urban areas with reliable internet connectivity.

**Statistics:**
- 67% of South Africans access internet primarily via mobile devices (ICASA, 2024)
- Data costs consume up to 15% of monthly income for low-income users (Research ICT Africa, 2024)
- Only 34% of platforms offer multi-language support beyond English and Afrikaans (own analysis)

**Duration:** This digital divide has persisted throughout South Africa's digital transformation (2010-present) and disproportionately affects rural and township communities.

**Previous Attempts:** Government-led digital literacy programmes and data subsidies have provided partial solutions, but platform design remains predominantly urban-centric.

**Impact on Target Population:** Potential sellers in townships cannot afford data costs for browsing image-heavy platforms or navigating English-only interfaces, excluding them from digital economic participation.

**Impact on Surrounding Populations:** Economic opportunities remain concentrated in urban areas, perpetuating spatial inequality and limiting wealth distribution.

#### 2.3 Inadequate Payment Infrastructure

**Problem:** Lack of integrated, secure payment systems supporting South African payment methods (Instant EFT, SnapScan, Capitec Pay, etc.) with buyer protection mechanisms.

**Statistics:**
- 76% of informal sector traders operate without merchant accounts or card payment facilities (Standard Bank, 2025)
- Transaction disputes account for 23% of abandoned C2C sales (PayFast, 2024)

**Duration:** This has been a persistent barrier since the emergence of digital payments in South Africa (2005-present), with limited solutions for small-scale sellers.

**Previous Attempts:** Payment gateway providers (PayFast, PayGate) exist but require business registration and monthly fees, creating barriers for informal traders.

**Impact on Target Population:** Sellers rely on manual EFT payments with no buyer protection, leading to payment disputes, refund complications, and lost sales.

**Impact on Surrounding Populations:** Consumers avoid C2C purchases due to payment risk, reducing overall market liquidity and limiting seller income.

#### 2.4 Delivery and Logistics Challenges

**Problem:** Absence of affordable, reliable delivery services connecting township sellers with buyers, particularly for non-urban destinations.

**Statistics:**
- Standard courier services charge R60-R120 per parcel, representing 20-40% of typical township product values (Courier Guy, 2024)
- 42% of township areas lack formal street addresses, complicating deliveries (StatsSA, 2025)

**Duration:** This infrastructural gap has existed throughout South Africa's e-commerce development, with minimal improvement in township logistics.

**Previous Attempts:** Informal taxi-based delivery networks operate but lack tracking, insurance, or standardised pricing.

**Impact on Target Population:** High delivery costs make small-value sales economically unviable, while delivery unreliability damages seller reputations.

**Impact on Surrounding Populations:** Rural and township buyers face limited product access, perpetuating geographical economic disparities.

#### 2.5 Seller Identity Verification Gap

**Problem:** No standardised system for verifying seller identities and business legitimacy within the informal sector context.

**Statistics:**
- 82% of informal traders operate without formal business registration (SEDA, 2024)
- Unverified sellers account for 67% of online marketplace fraud cases (SAFPS, 2023)

**Duration:** This verification gap has been present since the inception of C2C platforms in South Africa (2010-present).

**Previous Attempts:** Platforms require formal business registration documents, excluding 80%+ of informal sellers who lack such documentation.

**Impact on Target Population:** Legitimate informal sellers cannot distinguish themselves from fraudulent operators, limiting market access.

**Impact on Surrounding Populations:** Widespread fraud undermines entire marketplace trust, reducing participation across all user categories.

### Target Population

**Primary Users:**
- **Sellers:** Township-based entrepreneurs, informal traders, side-hustlers, crafters, home-based businesses
- **Age Range:** 18-45 years (62% of informal sector participants)
- **Geographic Focus:** Gauteng, Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal townships (highest informal economy concentration)
- **Economic Profile:** Monthly household income R3,000-R15,000

**Secondary Users:**
- **Buyers:** Urban and township consumers seeking affordable, locally-produced goods
- **Delivery Partners:** Existing informal logistics networks, taxi associations
- **Support Stakeholders:** SMME development organisations, local municipalities

### Scale of Impact

- **Potential Reach:** 3.2 million informal sector workers (Statistics South Africa, 2025)
- **Economic Impact:** Facilitate digital trade for R900 billion township economy
- **Geographic Scope:** National platform with initial focus on major metropolitan areas
- **Social Impact:** Financial inclusion, SMME development, youth unemployment reduction

## 1.6 CONCLUSION

### Summary of Proposal

Street2Screen ZA represents a strategic response to a critical gap in South Africa's digital economy: the absence of locally-appropriate C2C e-commerce infrastructure serving the R900 billion township informal sector. By developing a platform specifically designed for South African township entrepreneurs and consumers, this project addresses fundamental barriers of trust, accessibility, payment security, and logistical efficiency that currently prevent the digital formalisation of informal trade.

The platform will leverage proven technologies (PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap) while integrating local services (Brevo SMTP, PayFast) and incorporating South African contextual requirements (multi-language support, low-data optimization, township-friendly logistics). Through a phased 6-month development process, the project will deliver a fully functional, secure, and scalable C2C marketplace that empowers informal traders to transition from survival-based commerce to sustainable digital entrepreneurship.

### Potential Impact

#### Economic Impact:
- **Market Creation:** Enable digital participation for 3.2 million informal sector workers currently excluded from formal e-commerce
- **Revenue Generation:** Facilitate marketplace growth within the R900 billion township economy, keeping transaction value within South Africa
- **Employment:** Support entrepreneurship and self-employment as viable alternatives to formal sector job scarcity
- **Tax Revenue:** Increased economic visibility supports government revenue collection while maintaining informal sector inclusivity

#### Social Impact:
- **Financial Inclusion:** Provide access to secure digital payment systems for previously unbanked or underbanked populations
- **Skills Development:** Build digital literacy and business management capabilities among platform users
- **Community Empowerment:** Strengthen township economies through increased market access and consumer choice
- **Gender Equity:** Support women entrepreneurs who constitute significant informal sector participation

#### Technological Impact:
- **Innovation Demonstration:** Prove viability of locally-developed solutions addressing South African-specific challenges
- **Platform Replicability:** Create blueprint for similar interventions in other developing markets
- **Digital Infrastructure:** Contribute to national digital transformation goals and ICT development

#### Educational Impact:
- **Applied Learning:** Demonstrate real-world application of academic knowledge in software development, business analysis, and project management
- **Research Contribution:** Generate insights on C2C e-commerce adoption patterns in emerging markets
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Build partnerships between academia, informal sector organisations, and technology providers

### Alignment with National Priorities

This project directly supports:
- **National Development Plan 2030:** Digital economy development and SMME support
- **4th Industrial Revolution Commission:** Digital inclusion and local innovation
- **SMME Development Strategy:** Entrepreneurship enablement and access to markets
- **Financial Sector Code:** Financial inclusion targets for previously disadvantaged populations
